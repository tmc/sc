// Statecharts.
//
// This file defines a set of types that are used to represent statecharts.
//
// The design here is heavily inspired by both Harel's statecharts and the following paper:
// [Reconciling statechart semantics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642308001020).
// 
// A statechart SC is a tuple (S, T, E), with S a set of states, T - a set of transitions that connect the
// states, and E the set of events that transitions are triggered by. Set E is partitioned into sets E(ext)
// and E(int). Set E(ext) contains all external events, which are generated by the environment of the 
// system, while set E(int) contains all internal events, which are generated by transitions in T.
